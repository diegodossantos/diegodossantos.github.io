Learning git, github, and brushing up on basic css and html while I build my personal website. I'm documenting my steps here both for me and for others who may be starting with git, and creating their first website. While I'm doing a decent amount of research, I don't guarantee I'm following any current industry standard.

**Planned updates**

- [x] Set up GitHub page
- [x] Write first draft HTML
- [x] Write first draft CSS
- [x] Point domain to github.io page - [source](http://abdelraoof.com/blog/2014/09/20/configuring-namecheap-dns-for-github/)
- [x] Define pages
* v1: Home, About
* v2: Home, About, Arrow of time
* v3: Home, About, Arrow of time, Photos
- [ ] Research design/architecture of similar websites
- [ ] Hand draft wireframes that can scale
- [ ] Find HTML/CSS template
- [ ] Decide if I'm going to use Jekyll - if so, [doc](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
- [ ] Edit template to *match* final paper draft
- [ ] Implement clean URL if not on page boilerplate
- [x] Write Twitter Card code - [source](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary), [debugger](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
