      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>I’m a marketer and product manager living in Asheville, NC.</p>
      <p>I worked in social media marketing for 4 years, then transitioned to building web experiences blended with social elements, managing the social experiences for EMC and Dell's digital events. My next 6 were spent the following growing as a product manager. I then led the B2B lead gen sales chat application on dell.com, focusing on the experience for both end customers as well as for a global team of sales agents. During this time, I developed chat bots, expanded to messaging on WhatsApp, developed automations, helped break silos down between sales teams, ran 20+ experiments, and collaborated on the consolidation of the B2B and consumer sales chat.</p>

      <p>My approach to work is built around having strong relationships with stakeholders, intimately understanding prospects and customers, and have strong tech, team, and processes to deliver experiences that move the business forward. </p>
      <p>While I'm in tech, other industries I'd enjoy are renewables, media, agrotech, and fintech. </p>
      <p>When I’m not working, I’m usually outside with my wife and 3 boys. I’m into hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, paddle boarding, snowboarding, fly fishing, trail running and photography.</p>
      <p>I’m also interested in my long-term health through exercise, eating well, getting enough sleep, and mindfulness.  </p>
      
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      
          <h3>This site</h3>
              <p>I built this site to create my online presence and to refresh my technical skills. I chose Github Pages and Bootstrap to learn how to use HTML frameworks and Git, and to catch up on CSS.</p>

              <p>Still part of this site, but this project is focused on my fascination with the passing of time on my family and on me. </p>
